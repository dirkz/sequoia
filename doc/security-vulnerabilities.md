This document describes our process for handling security
vulnerabilities.  At the end of the document there is a list of
projects, and organizations who should be contacted.  If you would
like to be added to this list, please send a mail to
<security@sequoia-pgp.org> (6EFC2689882874C31E4FC4EC4D66CB0FEBA5DAF1),
mention your affiliation, and include an OpenPGP certificate.

# Reporting

Security-sensitive issues should be reported either via:

  - an email to security@sequoia-pgp.org, which is encrypted to
    6EFC2689882874C31E4FC4EC4D66CB0FEBA5DAF1.

  - a gitlab confidential issue
    - https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/new
    - Tick: "This issue is confidential...", which is just below
      the issue's description.

If someone publishes a security-sensitive issue (including creating a
public issue), then it may be necessary to forego responsible
disclosure, and publish a fix as soon as possible.

# Resolution

  1. Assess the impact of the issue:

     - Questions to consider:
       - What does an attacker need to trigger the issue?
       - What happens?  (abort? out-of-bounds read? out-of-bounds write?)

     - One approach for coming up with a severity is the Common
       Vulnerability Scoring System
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System

     - Current heuristic (improve this based on feedback and experience):
       - Low severity: denial of service
       - High severity: exfiltration of plaintext, exfiltration of
         secret key material, RCE

  1. Create and test a minimal patch

     - Candidate versions:
       - The latest version
       - The version in Debian stable
       - The version in Debian testing, if testing is frozen
       - Minor versions before an MSRV bump (i.e., if 1.x bumps the MSRV
         consider patching 1.x-1).
       - Downstreams may request patches for specific versions.
         If approved, add them to this list.  (Note: companies should be a
         partner, or have a support contract with us.)

     - Suggestions:
       - For testing purposes, gather all tests into a single file.  It
         is then easy to drop the test into any version of the code
         base and see if it is affected.
       - Because we want the patch to cleanly apply to many versions,
         don't append new tests to a sequence of unit tests.  This is
         because the unit tests are normally appended to, and this will
         very likely result in a merge conflict with earlier versions.
         Either prepend the test, or add it to a new file.

  1. Reach out to downstreams (see list below):

     - Inform them of the vulnerability
       - If the severity is greater than low, only inform them via a
         secure channel.  If no encryption key is available, only inform
         them on the flag day.
     - Share the analysis, and the patch.
     - Ask who needs an update for an old version, and who is happy
       with a new version.
     - For vulnerabilities that are higher than low severity,
       coordinate a flag day (suggest two weeks).

  1. Request a CVE ID
     - This is optional for low-severity issues
     - https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html

  1. On the flag day:
     - Release new versions of impacted software.
       - Depending on downstream needs, also release new versions of
         software still in use.  That said, most distributions are
         able to carry patches.

     - If the severity is high or critical, yank the impacted crates
       from crates.io
       https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-yank.html
       - As a general rule of thumb, we do not want to yank crates, as
         that can break downstream users who may not even be impacted
         by a vulnerability.
     - Inform any downstreams with whom we are not able to
       communicate with securely.
     - Report the vulnerability to RustSec
       https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
     - Send email to:
       - announce@lists.sequoia-pgp.org, devel@lists.sequoia-pgp.org,
         oss-security@lists.openwall.com
       - Credit the security researcher who did a resonsible disclosure
         with a thank you note in the release announcement.

  1. After flag day:
     - Make confidential issues public.
