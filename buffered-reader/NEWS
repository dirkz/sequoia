* Changes in 1.0.2
 * Notable fixes
   - A parser bug was fixed.  We classify this as a low-severity
     issue, because Rust correctly detects the out-of-bounds access
     and panics.  If an attacker controls the input, they may be able
     to use this bug to cause a denial of service.
* Changes in 1.0.1
** Notable fixes
   - Fixed a crash in Dup::read.

* Changes in 1.0.0

This is the initial stable release.
